HTML-WidgetValidator version 0.0.3

When HTML code is passed to HTML::WidgetValidator, it will analyze the code to see what kind
of Widget it is for. It is possible to pre-specify the type of Widget that will be detected
(if nothing is specified all included Widget types will be considered).

If the HTML Tag representing the Widget is too long, it is necessary to divide the HTML
code up by elements. For example the Yahoo! Weather Information code below is comprised of
two scripts, it is necessary to pass along each script separately.

    <script>var CFLwidth = "150";var CFLheight = "322";
    var CFLswfuri = "http://i.yimg.jp/images/weather/blogparts/yj_weather.swf?mapc=4";
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="euc-jp"
                src="http://weather.yahoo.co.jp/weather/promo/js/weather.js"></script>
